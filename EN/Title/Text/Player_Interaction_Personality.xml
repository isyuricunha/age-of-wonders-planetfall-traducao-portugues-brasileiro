It usually stands for either a numeric value, or a numeric value with an icon. Text between [ ] signs stands for a certain type of icon. {STR_leaderName} refers to the name of avatar of the player. Note that all the texts in this document that refer to two people - the speaker (NPC) and the one spoken too - that can both be male or female. All texts refer to a person that can either be male or female. If relevant for translation, please use the ‘localized string’ column for the male text and the ‘alternative localized string’ column for the female text.&#10;&#10;Note that use of the 'localized' and 'alternative localized string' only applies for the gender of the speaker.&#10;&#10;If the gender of the person spoken to requires inflection, please try to translate the text in a way that doesn't require such inflection. If this is impossible, please get in touch with us informing us of which lines this concerns and how they would be inflected in the language you are translating too.</Data></Cell>
