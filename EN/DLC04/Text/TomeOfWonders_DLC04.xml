      ss:Type="String">{XML_SPECIES_SHAKARN@RACE@DESCRIPTION}[br/][br/]ORIGIN: Not much is known about the Shakarn, although their agents seem to have been among us for longer than we realized. This reptilian race originates from an oceanic homeworld covered in atolls and archipelagos. Having conquered the sea, they took to the skies to further expand their empire, but when they first encountered the size and power of the Star Union, any invasion plans they had were postponed.[br/][br/]While the majority of the Shakarn forces bided their time on the edges of the known universe, their agents infiltrated key locations by mimicking the appearance of its inhabitants through advanced holo-tech, stealing any knowledge and technology they considered interesting. After the Cataclysm left the Star Union in ruins and chaos, the Shakarn have seized the opportunity to conquer the remnants of the human empire.</Data></Cell>

The project was shut down after backlash when their first test subject, called Deer, broadcast the horrid truth of the genetic experiments.[br/]Deer fled and took refuge with her newfound people, taking up arms for protection. Since then, the Therians, with their animal modifications and human weaponry, managed to survive on many of the planets they occupied.

The Preference trait is also revealed when the opposing player generates an opinion modifier on you because of their preferences.
